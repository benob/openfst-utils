Utilities for OpenFst
---------------------
Benoit Favre <benoit.favre@lif.univ-mrs.fr>

This is a set of useful programs for manipulating Finite State Transducer with the OpenFst library.

* fstcompile-nolex [-t]: compile an acceptor [transducer], generate symbol lexicons on the fly and save them with the fst. Useful for quick hacks on a single fst.

* fstminimize-transducer: encode input/output, rmepsilon, determinize, minimize and decode in one pass.

* fstdeterminize-tc-lex: keep the best tagging for each word sequence in a transducer using determinization in the (Tropical, Categorial)-Lexicographic semiring. See "Efficient Determinization of Tagged Word Lattices using Categorial and Lexicographic Semirings", by Izhak Shafran et al, ASRU 2011.

* add-tags <dict>: generate a tagging transducer from a word acceptor according to a tab-separated, one-word-per-line tag dictionary

* ngram-expand: expand transducer so that each arc has a fixed context of up to n-1 arcs (so called ngramize) -- non functional at this time

* fstcompose-phi.cc: does not work yet
